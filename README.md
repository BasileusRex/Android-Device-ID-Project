Android-Device-ID-Project
=========================

Freely available (GPLv3) xml files for the identification of Android devices.

How to contribute:

1) Fork
2) Fill in missing devices.
3) Pull request

or if it is a minor correction, fill an issue if you wish.


If a device has more than one common name (happens often with HTC), use the
most common name.

If a device has more than one model number (happens often with Samsung and
LGe), make a new entry for each model number.

If for the ro. values, use exact build.prop properties, even if a conflict
exists. Note conflicts in description (see Galaxy Nexus).


It is better to have incomplete entries, then erroneous entries.

Please have the filename be capitalized, with a lower case file extension.
